My personal reference for JavaScript concepts learned while building projects.

* Table of Contents

** Array Methods
- [[file:filter-method.org][.filter()]] - Create new array with items that pass test
- [[file:map-method.org][.map()]] - Transform all items into new array
- [[file:push-method.org][.push()]] - Add items to end (mutates)

** Core Concepts
- [[file:mutation.org][Mutation]] - Understanding what changes vs what creates new
- [[file:let-vs-const.org][let vs const]] - When to use each variable declaration
- [[file:array-index.org][Array Index Notation]] - Accessing items with [0], [1], etc.
- [[file:length-property.org][.length Property]] - Getting size of arrays/strings
- [[file:spread-operator.org][Spread Operator ...]] - Copying and combining arrays

** Syntax
- [[file:arrow-functions.org][Arrow Functions =>]] - Modern function shorthand

* Quick Reference

** Non-Mutating (Safe)
- ~.filter()~
- ~.map()~
- ~[...array]~ (spread)

** Mutating (Changes Original)
- ~.push()~
- ~.pop()~
- ~array[0] = ...~
- ~.sort()~

* Review Schedule

- First review: 1 hour after learning
- Second review: Next day
- Third review: 3 days later
- Fourth review: 1 week later
- Fifth review: 1 month later

* Active Recall Practice

Test yourself without looking at notes:

1. What's the difference between ~.map()~ and ~.filter()~?
2. Name 3 methods that mutate
3. How do you copy an array?
4. When should you use ~let~ vs ~const~?
5. What does ~.length~ return?
