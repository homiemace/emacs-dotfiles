* Big Questions

** What is this?
An array method that creates a NEW array by transforming every item.

** Why is this important?
Main way to transform data without mutating the original array.

** When will I need this?
- Doubling all numbers
- Converting names to uppercase
- Adding 10 points to all scores
- Any transformation applied to every item

** How does it work?
Runs a function on each item. Whatever the function returns becomes the new value in the new array.

* ELI5 Definition

You have a line of people. ~.map()~ is like asking each person to put on a hat, then they walk to a NEW line. The original line is still there without hats—you made a copy of the line where everyone has hats.

* Code Examples

** Example 1 (From Tutorial)
#+begin_src javascript
let numbers = [5, 10, 15];
let doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
// doubled = [10, 20, 30]
// numbers = [5, 10, 15] (unchanged)
#+end_src

** My Own Example
#+begin_src javascript
let scores = [85, 90, 78];
let curved = scores.map(score => score + 5);
// curved = [90, 95, 83]
// scores = [85, 90, 78] (unchanged)
#+end_src

** Real Code I Used
#+begin_src javascript
// From my projects page:
let result = scores.map(s => s + 10);
#+end_src

* Pattern I Noticed

#+begin_src javascript
array.map(item => transformation)
//        ↑      ↑
//     parameter  what to do to it
#+end_src

Every item gets transformed → all items stay (array length doesn't change)

* Mutation?

❌ *NO* - Creates a NEW array, original is unchanged

* Key Difference from .filter()

- ~.map()~ → same number of items, transformed
- ~.filter()~ → potentially fewer items, unchanged

* Active Recall Questions

1. Does ~.map()~ change the length of the array?
2. What does ~.map()~ return?
3. Write code to triple all numbers in an array

** Answers
1. No (unless you return undefined, but generally no)
2. A new array with transformed items
3. ~nums.map(n => n * 3)~
