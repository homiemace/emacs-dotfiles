* Big Questions

** What is this?
An array method that creates a NEW array containing only items that pass a test.

** Why is this important?
It's the main way to remove unwanted items from arrays without mutating the original.

** When will I need this?
- Filtering projects by tags
- Removing completed tasks
- Finding users over age 18
- Any time you need a subset of an array

** How does it work?
Tests each item with a function. If function returns true, item goes in new array. If false, item is excluded.

* ELI5 Definition

Imagine you have a bag of mixed candies. ~.filter()~ is like dumping them out, picking only the red ones, and putting those in a NEW bag. The original bag is still full of mixed candies—you didn't touch it.

* Code Examples

** Example 1 (From Tutorial)
#+begin_src javascript
let nums = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20];
let result = nums.filter(n => n >= 10);
// result = [10, 15, 20]
// nums = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20] (unchanged)
#+end_src

** My Own Example
#+begin_src javascript
let tags = ['Web', 'AI', 'Games', 'Blog'];
let longTags = tags.filter(tag => tag.length > 3);
// longTags = ['Games', 'Blog']
// tags = ['Web', 'AI', 'Games', 'Blog'] (unchanged)
#+end_src

** Real Code I Used
#+begin_src javascript
// From my projects page:
data.projects.filter((project) => {
    return project.tags.includes(tag.label);
})
#+end_src

* Pattern I Noticed

#+begin_src javascript
array.filter(item => condition)
//           ↑      ↑
//        parameter  test (returns true/false)
#+end_src

If test is true → keep item
If test is false → exclude item

* Mutation?

❌ *NO* - Creates a NEW array, original is unchanged

* Related Concepts

- Compare to ~.map()~ → transforms items instead of filtering
- Compare to ~.push()~ → mutates instead of creating new array
- Works with: ~.length~, arrow functions, comparison operators

* Active Recall Questions

1. Does ~.filter()~ mutate the original array?
2. What does ~.filter()~ return if nothing passes the test?
3. Write code to filter numbers greater than 50

** Answers
1. No
2. Empty array ~[]~
3. ~nums.filter(n => n > 50)~
